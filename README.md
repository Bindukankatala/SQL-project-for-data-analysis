# SQL-project-for-data-analysis
Designed and built a complete relational database from scratch using SQL. This project involved creating multiple tables, defining schemas (data types, primary/foreign keys), and populating them with sample data. I then wrote analytical queries to analyze the data, demonstrating database design and DML/DDL skills.
